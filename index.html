<div id='heading-container'>
    <h1> What is it I am good At?</h1>
    <p> Sometimes it can be tricky to tell what css goes with which element, so take your time.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p class='step-text'>Make sure you read the CSS through carefully. Take a look at classes and id. They play a pretty important role in how CSS prioritizes things.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p class='step-text'> Try and figure out the answers to the quiz. Give each question some time and attention, but it's okay if you don't feel 100% sure on some of the questions. </p> 
    <h3 id='final-step'>Step 3</h3>
    <p class='step-text' id='final-step-text'> Remove line 1 from the CSS to check your work. Make sure you've finished answering the questions to the best of your ability first!</p>
